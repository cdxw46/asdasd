# SMURF PBX

SMURF is an in-house SIP PBX platform under active development. This repository contains **original SMURF code** (no Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, Kamailio, or OpenSIPS embedded as engines).

Replicating every feature of commercial suites such as 3CX is a **long-term roadmap**, not something represented in full by a single revision of this tree. What is implemented here is a **real, runnable core**: PostgreSQL-backed extensions, SIP REGISTER with digest (MD5 for registration, SHA-256 for in-dialog proxy auth on INVITE), UDP/TCP/TLS listeners for SIP, a symmetric RTP relay process, internal INVITE routing with SDP rewriting, CDR rows, HTTPS management API on **port 5001** with JWT and a minimal admin SPA, plus `install.sh` and **systemd** units.

## Ports

| Service    | Port | Protocol | Notes                          |
|-----------|------|----------|--------------------------------|
| SIP       | 5060 | UDP/TCP  | configurable via env          |
| SIP TLS   | 5061 | TCP/TLS  | optional (`SMURF_SIP_TLS`)   |
| Admin/API | 5001 | HTTPS    | self-signed cert by installer |
| RTP relay | dynamic | UDP   | allocated per call on relay bind IP |
| Relay control | 19000 | TCP | localhost only by default     |

## Quick install (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo SMURF_LISTEN_IP=127.0.0.1 ./install.sh
```

- **Admin UI**: `https://<host>:5001/` — user `admin`, password `smurfadmin` (change after install).
- **SIP extension**: `1000` / secret `smurf1000` (from `sql/seed.sql`).

Environment overrides live in `/etc/smurf/smurf.env`.

## Development

```bash
go test ./...
go build -o smurfrelay ./cmd/smurfrelay
go build -o smurfsip ./cmd/smurfsip
go build -o smurfapi ./cmd/smurfapi
```

## Honest scope

Further work is required for full enterprise parity (WebRTC stack, T.38, HA clustering, full RFC3261 edge cases, SRTP, ICE/TURN integration, mobile push, and so on). The architecture here is intended to grow: separate `smurfsip`, `smurfrelay`, and `smurfapi` processes, PostgreSQL as the source of truth, and systemd supervision.
